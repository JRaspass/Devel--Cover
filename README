NAME
    Devel::Cover - a module to provide code coverage for Perl

    Version 0.01 - 9th May 2001

DESCRIPTION
    Copyright 2001, Paul Johnson (pjcj@cpan.org)

    This software is free. It is licensed under the same terms as Perl
    itself.

    The latest version of this software should be available from my
    homepage: http://www.pjcj.net

    This module provides code coverage for Perl.

    If you can't guess by the version number this is an alpha release.

    Code coverage data are collected using a plugable runops subroutine
    which counts how many times each op is executed. These data are then
    mapped back to reality using the B compiler modules.

    At the moment, only statement coverage information is reported. Coverage
    data for other metrics are collected, but not reported. Coverage data
    for some metrics are not yet collected.

    Requirements: Perl 5.6.1 or bleadperl. The ability to compile XS
    extensions.
